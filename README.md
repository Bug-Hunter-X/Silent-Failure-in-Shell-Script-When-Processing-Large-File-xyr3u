# Silent Failure in Shell Script When Processing Large File

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a shell script that processes a large file. The script silently fails without an informative error message when the system's maximum open file descriptor limit is exceeded. The failure is not immediately apparent, as the script processes some lines before failing.

## Bug Description
The script reads a large file line by line.  If the file is larger than the system's open file descriptor limit, the `read` command will eventually fail, but the script does not handle this error properly.  Instead of reporting an error, it simply stops processing lines.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Create a large file named `large_file.txt` (e.g., using `head /dev/urandom | tr -dc A-Za-z0-9\n | head -n 1000000 > large_file.txt`)
2. Run the script `bug.sh`. Observe that it processes some lines, but then silently stops before finishing.
3. Check the system's open file descriptor limit using `ulimit -n`.

## Solution
The solution involves using `xargs` to process the file in chunks, avoiding the need to keep all lines open simultaneously.  The improved script handles errors gracefully and provides helpful error messages.
